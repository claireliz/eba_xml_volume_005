            last year, when we passed the large and important island of <geogName ref="#São_Miguel_Island_Azores">San Miguel</geogName>. 
            Today we passed in between <geogName ref="#Faial_Island_Azores">Fayal</geogName> and <country ref="#Spain">San Jose</country> - then

            <p>We reached <placeName ref="#Port_Said">Port Said</placeName> Saturday at midnight - 
            the usual fracas and disagreeable features of coaling all night.
            Ports, doors, everything closed - noise etc. - to my thinking there is nothing gained by
            going on to <placeName ref="#Ismailia_Egypt">Ismailia</placeName> - better solve the unpleasant 
            problem by quitting the steamer at any hour she arrives, and accepting anything that can be found at

            getting through <geogName ref="#Sweet_Water_Canal">the canal</geogName> the next day, sticking several times, and did not 
            reach <placeName ref="#Ismailia_Egypt">Ismailia</placeName> until 7:30 - waited some time for the tender, and did not 
            land before 9:30 - a passable supper - and bed rooms - <persName ref="#Buttles_Nettie">Nettie</persName> and 
            <pb n="137"/> in one room - my bed so chill and damp, that I have suffered much from it - we reached 
            <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName> at 6 P.M. and were soon installed in our old corner 
            rooms to the north - feeling very much at home. We drove down to the boat this morning - finding her almost in sailing
            condition. There remain however, all the stores to be unpacked, and a thousand little
            things to be arranged and settled.</p>

            had I only my dear <persName ref="#Toby">Toby</persName> here! How glad I am to quit all that entourage at Shepheards, I
            cannot even express to myself! I have had 10 days of real illness - several days in my

            - cold - high winds - and little sunshine. We kept a steady fire in our sitting room. Everyone

            half the time in their beds. We found our faithful <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammad">Mohammed Salah</persName>

            and <persName ref="#Ibrahim">Ibrahim</persName>. We had our Xmas this morning, and gave the men all around,

            The men had - sheep - and I went into town this afternoon <pb n="138"/> to find all the shops closed. Last evening being Christmas night, 
            <persName ref="Bend_Mrs.">Mrs. Bend</persName> and <unclear>the girls</unclear> dined with us. The first dinner of our new

            have dawdelled away much time in fear of our big sail, which proves too big.

            <p>They all made an early start for <placeName ref="#Sakkarah">Sakkarah</placeName> this morning - 
            even <persName ref="#Jones_Daniel">Jones</persName> and <persName ref="#Amilie">Amilie</persName>. 
            I sent <persName ref="#Amilie">Amilie</persName> as she had never seen it. 
            They all condoled with me on going off, because I was to be left all alone for the day. 
            But after they got away, I smiled and began to enjoy myself! I mended 2 sponge bags - 
            I explored the little store closet under the stairs, arranged and condensed it - put in order 
            the linen closet and my dress closet, re-arranged <persName ref="#Abdul">Abdul’s</persName> 
            sideboard for him - the bookcase and all the small things - and after a delicious little lunch, 
            with <persName ref="#Abdul">Abdul</persName> waiting upon me so quietly and faithfully, 
            I took a book and stretch myself upon the divan in the saloon - where I could neither read or sleep 
            <pb n="139"/> because of enjoying the delicious quiet and repose. The first quiet day I have had for
            almost a year! I enjoyed the occasional bursts of sunshine through the window, across
            the mossy green carpet, and the big green chair, making a delicate harmony with the line
            of young wheat growing on the bank - and the palms tossing their branches above. The
            <name type="boat" ref="#Rameses">Rameses</name> came up from Cairo - on which are <persName ref="#Whitehead_Mr">Mr.</persName> 
            and <persName ref="#Whitehead_Mrs">Mrs. Whitehead</persName> - and <persName ref="#Whitehead_Mr">Mr. W.</persName> 
            came over to make me a little visit - reporting <persName ref="#Whitehead_Mrs">Mrs. W.</persName> 
            afraid to venture out in the cold, and only 35 passengers. I asked him why he had not gone to see wonderful 
            <placeName ref="#Sakkarah">Sakkarah</placeName>, and he said “he thought he would get enough of temples and pyramids 
            before he got out of Egypt”! Our people came back about 5, raving about their delicious day. We find our
            little stoves most comfortable and cheerful - we could hardly exist without them. All
            day long, the big sail has been stretched on shore, with the men ripping and cutting -
            now she is pronounced to be all right and is again in place on the boom. Every inch of
            the boat outside and in, was painted last summer, in admirable fashion, making a great
            improvement in the <name type="boat" ref="#Beduin">Beduin</name>. I never saw more beautiful paint - the tints so perfect - and
            the finish like porcelain. We seem now to be quite perfect.</p>

            It is very still and quiet - not a sound to be heard outside - the men all asleep - not a sound - 
            and I intend as I always do, to see the old year out. It is cold - but no wind - we had a great surprise this morning. 
            I knew it was very cold, and <persName ref="#Jones_Daniel">Jones</persName> had come into my room and lighted my 
            little stove, which made a cheerful light in my darkened room, it being hardly past 7 o’clock - when I heard 
            <persName ref="#Monty">Monty</persName> asking if he could come in, that he had something to show me. 
            So in he came, wrapped in his bathrobe with his hat on, and a little tray in his hand on which was heaped a little pile of
            snow, or more strictly speaking frost! He said the decks were white with it - that there
            was a dense fog, and the extreme cold had turned it to snow, wherever it touched. All
            the men were tremendously impressed - only one or two every having seen anything of the
            kind before.</p>
            
            <pb n="141"/><p>It took the sun a long time to dissipate the fog - but at last the
            clearest and brightest day we have had since we came, evolved itself - and after a
            general cleaning and rubbing and drying of the decks, we sailed away in a very light
            wind which continued until nearly 8 o’clock - when we tied up. I have been on deck most
            of the time - air so delicious -dry - and with a real snap of cold in it. We have made
            about 12 miles.</p>

            snow. It was not until after 9 o’clock that the sun came out, and shown fitfully and

            at one o’clock. All of the rest went into the town for our mail and some shopping. 
            The wind was so strong and the dust and sand so filled the air, that I stopped at home.

            and started among the crowd of working boats, only to find we had left one of our sailors 
            on shore, who had been sent to find some vegetables. An exciting time for a few moments, 
            when we finally got under way with a fair wind increasing to strong - and we did some 
            splendid and difficult sailing - it was like yachting. We saw the minarets of <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiut</placeName> 
            all the afternoon appear and disappear - but as usual seemed to get no nearer to them. 
            After we tied up, the wind began to blow, and rain poured smartly for half an hour.

            Light winds and some tracking brought us early in the afternoon to <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiut</placeName>. 
            The <name type="boat" ref="#Nitassis">Nitassis</name> passed down. Got a big mail of papers and letters - and had, for the first time 
            some positive information in regard to the sudden move of troops from <country ref="#Cairo">Cairo</country> to 
            <placeName ref="#Sudan">the Sudan</placeName>. It was at first reported that the emergency was so great, 
            that most of <persName ref="#Cook_Thomas">Cook’s</persName> steamers would be required, as he has the contract with 
            Government to carry troops - but it seems that was an exaggeration. They go by rail to 
            <placeName ref="#Nag_Hammadi">Nag Hamadi</placeName>, and then are shipped. An officer told 
            <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> today, that the finishing of the railway between 
            <placeName ref="#Nag_Hammadi">Nag Hamadi</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Aswan">Assouan</placeName>, was to
            be pushed on to rapid finish. <persName ref="#Buttles_Nettie">Nettie</persName> and I took a drive into 
            <placeName ref="#Asyut">Assiut</placeName> this afternoon. A
            <pb n="144"/> very large and growing town - especially the European quarter - near the river,
            and <placeName ref="#American_Mission_College">American Mission College</placeName>. We waited some time at the gate of a garden, where 
            <persName ref="#Abdul">Abdul</persName>,and a kind of rais belonging to the carriage, a mere bundle of rags, with a smiling
            yellow face above, who seemed to be the elder brother of the two wretched little horses,
            went to get me some flowers. We thought we had never seen so many varieties of humanity
            as passed and repassed continually - with many it would have been hard from appearance
            to have drawn the line between the beast and the human. The <name type="boat" ref="#Rameses The Third">The Ramesis the Third</name> 
            came to the landing near us, and a small Gage steamer, with <persName ref="#Henri_de Bourbon_Prince">Prince Henri de Bourbon</persName>

            It is a holiday - being the 8th anniversary of the accession of the Khodive. The town was therefore crowded - and we
            drove through solid masses of turbaned humanity. We had no one with us but our driver -
            but we did not meet with the slightess rudeness - though it was as well perhaps that we
            did not understand all that was said to us. The moon makes such beauty, rising above the

            this afternoon, having waited all day for the plumber to finish his work in my room. We

            American flag, and hearing from one of our sailors that it was a “Hakim”, we thought it
            might be some of the people of the American Mission School, as we know they sometimes go
            out in this way - and wishing much to talk to them, we went down to call. But we found
            the “Hakim” was a dentist with a very Hebrew name, and his card bore the title of
            dentist to the Khodive. Theodore, asked him if he would like to see our boat, thereupon
            he came, bringing with him a <unlclear>most respectable citizen</unclear> of <placeName ref="#Sohag">Sohag</placeName>, 
            who he introduced as one of the “old Egyptian nobles” - whatever that might be. He then asked if he could bring

            state. <persName ref="#Sohag_Mudir">The Mudir</persName> was very well dressed in European fashion - and spoke admirable English

            <p>A fine warm day - wind light - reached this place at 4 o’clock - found the R.R. bridge closed

            and the rest went for a walk - and met and talked with the Engineer of the bridge - an Englishman - who

            They saw a large barge with horses, and about 5 camels, and ammunition cars, waiting for the

            for the day. At 12:30 we were off, and a light south wind springing up we came along right merrily 
            - when the wind failed - the head has been intense - 95⁰ on my back balcony - but that has some reflection. 
            Pulled up at 7 o’clock just as a sudden, howling wind came up and made our landing very difficult. Suppose we
            are about 5 miles from <placeName ref="#Kom_Ombo">Kom Ombo</placeName>. The air is so charged with sand that the moon can just

            - and stopped, and next appeared the <name type="boat" ref="#Miriam">“Miriam”</name> the Egyptian Museum boat, 
            with a tug, and stopped behind us - so that the settlement is a large one tonight. We had had a pleasant 
            scheme for taking tea in the temple this afternoon - but the high wind, and all the people from the boats made
            it impossible.</p>

            and river, and remains of former human habitation. Then we went to <unclear>the Antar</unclear> 
            and saw the head and crown of the splendid hawk - as large as
            a big apple, of pure gold with a crown of gold 6 in. high, representing the

            but can be reconstructed. Then we were shown in the portico of the little house on shore, what is more interesting
            historically, a kneeling figure in stone, very crude and archaic, what <persName ref="#Somers_Clarke_Mr">Mr. S.-C.</persName>

            The ride through the desert valley - with the great arid mountains around us, and the

            <p>A beautiful quiet day - and we have made 38 miles - no wind, except the lightest 
            breath from the north now and then. Our men have rowed valiantly for 12 hours - and 
            we are now lying about 6 miles from <placeName ref="#Ballianeh">Ballianeh</placeName>. 
            The <name type="boat" ref="#Mimi">Mimi</name> has been just behind us until 5 o’clock, 
            when she stopped where the <name type="boat" ref="#Nephtys">“Nephtys”</name> and

            <placeName ref="#Nagh_Hamadi">Nagh Hamadi</placeName>. We were just in time for the bridge 
            at the latter place - which was just opening as we came up to it, and were the first to come through
            there being 3 steamers and the <name type="boat" ref="#Mimi">“Mimi”</name> - and in spite of

            - and although the 2 hours ride out there even with the worst donkeys in the world, was 
            delightful over that wide cultivated country - the wheat quite grown and bearded - oats well formed, 
            and the air full of blossoming clover - yet the coming home was tiring in the extreme - 
            bad donkey boys, unpleasant, natives, and intolerable donkeys, almost spoiled the lovely face of nature.
            We could not go to the <placeName ref="#Tomb_of_Osiris">tomb of Osiris</placeName> as no one could

            <p>Began rowing at 5:30 - at 9 o’clock the north wind was so
            strong we gave it up and went to shore. It blew a gale until 7 o’clock when we dropped

            <p>An exasperating day. We started early and rowed around the two great
            turns between <placeName ref="#Manfalout">Manfalout</placeName> and half way past the

            congratulating ourselves that we were going to pass it, when the north wind became so
            strong, we had to stop before making the last turn - as these dangerous cliffs come down
            quite to the <pb n="#168"> water - and here we are still, with the lights of another dahabeah
            showing a little above us - we do not know what. Every night now we have 3 or 4 Gaffirs
            or guards watching us - as this part of the river always has a bad reputation - and
            there is much excitement now over the sad murder a short time since 
            <unclear>at Maghagah of Lord Cowper’s valet</unclear>, who left the dahabeah for the Post Ofice, 
            and missing his way back, was decoyed it is supposed into the sugar cane. His body was 
            found the same evening robbed - and he had been strangled after a violent struggle. This 
            has made a great stir - especially as two murders of natives in the same vicinity have since 
            taken place. The <name type="boat" ref="#Mimi">“Mimi”</name> passed us this afternoon in tow of a tug. 
            Made about 8 miles.</p>

            This morning before 7 o’clock the <name type="boat" ref="#Herodotus">Herodotus</name>

            She must have been there a long time and we were just preparing to offer assistance, when 
            she began to start. Too windy to be on deck today until about 4 o’clock when I went up 
            - and we had tea there - and a beautiful sail, or row until dark - passing the end of the 
            <geogName ref="#Abu_Feydah_Mts">Abu Feydah chain</geogName> - with a lovely bank of palm trees 
            - villages - fields - cattle, sheep and the evening air of repose over all. There is a dahabeah just
            behind us, but too far for us to make her out. She is probably the <name type="boat" ref="#Alma">Alma</name>.</p>

            saw her plainly - her stern right in the bank and slightly tilted. None of the family
            visible - and she had the air of having adapted herself to the situation. 
            <persName ref="#Daivs_Theodore">Theodore</persName> sent word to ask if we could help her - 
            but it seems she had been there for more than a day, and there was nothing but a tug - so 
            after stopping a moment we came on. The <name type="boat" ref="#Mimi">Mimi</name> passed us

            from being sent on to the rocky cliffs - and we have not moved since, except as the wind
            has swayed us. The ominous sky brought the storm just as we had finished dinner. It blew
            tremendously, and the rain fell in torrents. The boat proved very tight, the only leaks
            being in my room, where the roof is higher - and at this offset there were several leaks
            - and towels, cups and bowls were put in requisition. I took a volume of McMasters
            History of the People of the United States from the bookcases this evening, and chanced
            upon the interesting and pathetic history of the settlement of Galliopolis in Ohio -

            <p>I did not get to bed last night until nearly one o’clock. The storm which seemed to 
            pass away in the evening, burst upon us again after eleven. All the family had gone to bed

            stayed up and again put in use the bowls, cups, and towels. For the first time, I really felt a 
            little afraid as we were lying in the middle of the river - we had 3 anchors down, and the 
            boat tugged at them most unpleasantly. Early this morning we pulled to the anchor to a safer place, 
            and put out our 3 anchors on a little sand island, where we are still lying, the wind having blown 
            great guns all day. The <name type="boat" ref="#Ramses">Ramses</name> passed us early - feeling 
            her way very cautiously indeed. I went on deck for a few moments after tea - but it was too windy to be 
            pleasant - though the air was soft and deliciously full of the fragrance of clover blossoms.

            <p>We have had the most exciting day I ever passed <corr>on</corr> the Nile. 
            We began the day early, with a light south wind - and found the river
            very difficult. About 10 o’clock we descried a Cook Steamer evidently stuck on the sand, 
            ahead of us - and on coming up with her found her to be the 
            <name type="boat" ref="#Ammartis">Ammartis</name>, which passed us
            yesterday. She was surrounded by gyasses, who were relieving her of some of her luggage.
            Not long after we passed the Steamer <name type="boat" ref="#Shellal">Shellal</name>, 
            a complete wreck, and partly submerged. She was deserted and in the hands of the wreckers 
            - having stove a hole in her bottom on some unsuspected stones in the river. Half an hour 
            after sitting at luncheon, our boat gave a sudden lurch, and there was a grinding of stones 
            under her bow. We all rushed on forward deck, fearing some real calamity; but examination 
            showed no leak, and we came on our way rejoicing; but it was rather nervous work for awhile. 
            Next we saw one of the large <name type="boat" ref="#Gage_Steamer">Gage steamers</name>, 
            empty, and abandoned, and left tied to the bank, to wait for higher water, so that she 
            could get down the river. Then we came up the <name type="boat" ref="#Ammartis">Ammartis</name>, 
            who had got off the sand, and passed us a short time before, transferring her passengers to the
            <name type="boat" ref="#Tewfik">Tewfik</name>, who was sending her to the 
            <name type="boat" ref="#Ammartis">Ammartis</name> - the latter drawing less water. So when we
            found ourselves tonight 6 miles below <placeName ref="#Al_Wasta">Wasta</placeName> and having 
            made 37 miles, and only touched sand once for a moment, we congratulated ourselves. A beautiful

            among the hills and around the lake. All the country is full of blossoming cherry trees

            nightingales at 4 o’clock this morning. Wrote letters this afternoon and we had 
            tea out on our balcony. Magnificent sunset effects - rosy snow mts. and clouds
