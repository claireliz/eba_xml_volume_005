            out to Florence for the winter. So that it was like a reception all the way over. Every afternoon they all came to tea with me in the saloon

            much this summer. Today we passed the <geogName ref="Azores_Islands">Azores</geogName> - not keeping to the south as we did 
            last year, when we passed the large and important island of <geogName ref="São_Miguel_Island_Azores">San Miguel</geogName>. 
            Today we passed in between <geogName ref="Faial_Island_Azores">Fayal</geogName> and <country ref="Spain">San Jose</country> - then

            <p>We reached <placeName ref="Port_Said_Egypt">Port Said</placeName> Saturday at midnight - 
            the usual fracas and disagreeable features of coaling all night.
            Ports, doors, everything closed - noise etc. - to my thinking there is nothing gained by
            going on to <placeName ref="Ismailia_Egypt">Ismailia</placeName> - better solve the unpleasant 
            problem by quitting the steamer at any hour she arrives, and accepting anything that can be found at

            rooms to the north - feeling very much at home. We drove down to the boat this morning - finding her almost in sailing
            condition. There remain however, all the stores to be unpacked, and a thousand little
            things to be arranged and settled.</p>

            At last we are settled in this our delightful little winter home - and it would be entirely perfect
            had I only my dear <unclear>Toby</unclear> here! How glad I am to quit all that entourage at Shepheards, I
            cannot even express to myself! I have had 10 days of real illness - several days in my
            bed. In all my life I have never been so ill - the winter is a bad one in <country ref="Egypt">Egypt</country> 
            - cold - high winds - and little sunshine. We kept a steady fire in our sitting room. Everyone
            has a cold. <persName ref="Bend_Mrs.">Mrs. Bend</persName> and <persName ref="Norman_Mrs.">Mrs. Norman</persName> 
            half the time in their beds. We found our faithful <persName ref="Salah_Mohammad">Mohammed Salah</persName>

            and <persName ref="Ibrahim">Ibrahim</persName>. We had our Xmas this morning, and gave the men all around,

            and <unclear>the girls</unclear> dined with us. The first dinner of our new cook - and a very good dinner it was 
            - quite admirable - they were quite impressed.</p>
            </div> 
            
            Monday, Dec. 27 Monty and I paid a hurried visit to Hatoun’s and
            Parvis’s shops this morning, and hurried back - we got off at 12:30 in a very good wind
            and reached Bedrashein in less than 3 hours - have dawdelled away much time in fear of
            our big sail, which proves too big. Theodore has decided to have it made smaller
            tomorrow, and to kill two birds with one stone by visiting Sakkarah, which we did not
            intend doing until we come down - as I am not now very fit. So Rais Fuli took the 6
            o’clock train to Cairo to fetch the sail makers. Cold. 
            
            Tuesday, Dec. 18. They all made
            an early start for Sakkarah this morning - even Jones and Amilie. I sent Amilie as she
            had never seen it. They all condoled with me on going off, because I was to be left all
            alone for the day. But after they got away, I smiled and began to enjoy myself! I mended
            2 sponge bags - I explored the little store closet under the stairs, arranged and
            consensed it - put in order the linen closet and my dress closet, re-arranged Abdul’s
            sideboard for him - the bookcase and all the small things - and after a delicious little
            lunch, with Abdul waiting upon me so quietly and faithfully, I took a book and stretch
            myself upon the divan in the saloon - where I could neither read or sleep 
            
            PAGE 139
            because of enjoying the delicious quiet and repose. The first quiet day I have had for
            almost a year! I enjoyed the occasional bursts of sunshine through the window, across
            the mossy green carpet, and the big green chair, making a delicate harmony with the line
            of young wheat growing on the bank - and the palms tossing their branches above. The
            Rameses came up from Cairo - on which are Mr. and Mrs. Whitehead - and Mr. W. came over
            to make me a little visit - reporting Mrs. W. afraid to venture out in the cold, and
            only 35 passengers. I asked him why he had not gone to see wonderful Sakkarah, and he
            said “he thought he would get enough of temples and pyramids before he got out of
            Egypt”! Our people came back about 5, raving about their delicious day. We find our
            little stoves most comfortable and cheerful - we could hardly exist without them. All
            day long, the big sail has been stretched on shore, with the men ripping and cutting -
            now she is pronounced to be all right and is again in place on the boom. Every inch of
            the boat outside and in, was painted last summer, in admirable fashion, making a great
            improvement in the Beduin. I never saw more beautiful paint - the tints so perfect - and
            the finish like porcelain. We seem now to be quite perfect. 
            
            Wednesday - Dec. 29. The day
            began cold, with a south wind which changed to north about one o’clock - and we sailed
            away until 4 P.M. when it veered to west, and we tied up, after having made 8 miles -
            the sail proves quite perfect. PAGE 140 Dec. 30. Thursday. We made an early start this
            morning before 7 - the wind good and strengthening all the time - at 1 o’clock we were
            driven on a sand bank - but pulled to the anchor and got away and sailed finely until
            about 6 P.M. when we stopped for the night near Wasta, having made about 33 miles - very
            cold and windy. We are going to have a hard time on the river this year I fear, as it is
            so uncommonly low - and the current is running so strong. It has rained from time to
            time today. 31 Dec. Friday evening. We have been sitting about since dinner, talking and
            reading. I have been reading aloud in Sayce’s “Egypt of the Hebrews” then Theodore read
            from “In Memoriam”. It is very still and quiet - not a sound to be heard outside - the
            men all asleep - not a sound - and I intend as I always do, to see the old year out. It
            is cold - but no wind - we had a great surprise this morning. I knew it was very cold,
            and Jones had come into my room and lighted my little stove, which made a cheerful light
            in my darkened room, it being hardly past 7 o’clock - when I heard Monty asking if he
            could come in, that he had something to show me. So in he came, wrapped in his bathrobe
            with his hat on, and a little tray in his hand on which was heaped a little pile of
            snow, or more strictly speaking frost! He said the decks were white with it - that there
            was a dense fog, and the extreme cold had turned it to snow, wherever it touched. All
            the men were tremendously impressed - only one or two every having seen anything of the
            kind before. PAGE 141 It took the sun a long time to dissipate the fog - but at last the
            clearest and brightest day we have had since we came, evolved itself - and after a
            general cleaning and rubbing and drying of the decks, we sailed away in a very light
            wind which continued until nearly 8 o’clock - when we tied up. I have been on deck most
            of the time - air so delicious -dry - and with a real snap of cold in it. We have made
            about 12 miles. January 1 - 1898. The New Year dawned cold and dark - when I first
            looked out of my window, the river was as smooth as a mirror, and the clouds looked like
            snow. It was not until after 9 o’clock that the sun came out, and shown fitfully and
            dimly. The wind too was fitful - however we sailed as we could until nearly 7 o’clock -
            the moon being half full. Passed Beni soef about noon and cannot be far from Fashon
            tonight - making about 11 miles. 2d Sunday after Christmas. Jan. 2. Have made 48 miles 0
            and are now lying 2 miles south of Sheik Fadl. Still cold. The other afternoon I saw a
            large fox running along the waters edge - apparently disturbed at our nearness. However
            by the time Jones got his gun out he disappeared over the bank. PAGE 142 Jan. 3. Monday.
            We made 30 miles - starting at 7:30 and pulled up at Minieh at one o’clock. All of the
            rest went into the town for our mail and some shopping. The wind was so strong and the
            dust and sand so filled the air, that I stopped at home. Even the deck was impossible -
            and the wind increasing we have not moved. Tuesday. Jan. 4. Started soon after 6:30 this
            A.M. a clear, brilliant morning, the wind good increasing to strong. We sailed
            splendidly without a break until 6 o’clock or thereabouts, making 55-1/2 miles. The air
            was softer, and the sun bright, the afternoon delicious. I was on deck from 11 A.M. to 5
            P.M. Wednesday. 5 Jan. Still cold, with light north wind growing stronger - we made 6
            miles, when in the first great turn of the beginning of the Abufedah Mts. we were
            obliged to furl our sail and anchor. The steamer Tewfik, with Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt
            passed up - giving us a salute as he passed. We tracked later, for about a mile to a
            good place for the night. Passed Manfalout about noon, and altogether made 9 miles. Cold
            with a little rain this evening. PAGE 143 6 Jan. Thursday. A cold day - the morning very
            quiet until nearly noon, when we pulled up our stakes and started among the crowd of
            working boats, only to find we had left one of our sailors on shore, who had been sent
            to find some vegetables. An exciting time for a few moments, when we finally got under
            way with a fair wind increasing to strong - and we did some splendid and difficult
            sailing - it was like yachting. We saw the minarets of Assiut all the afternoon appear
            and disappear - but as usual seemed to get no nearer to them. After we tied up, the wind
            began to blow, and rain poured smartly for half an hour. The sailors made a great row on
            deck, getting the furniture together and covered and the awnings up. Made 18 miles. 7
            Jan. Friday. A beautiful day - almost warm - and almost like Egypt. Light winds and some
            tracking brought us early in the afternoon to Assiut. The Nitassis passed down. Got a
            big mail of papers and letters - and had, for the first time some positive information
            in regard to the sudden move of troops from Cairo to the Sudan. It was at first reported
            that the emergency was so great, that most of Cook’s steamers would be required, as he
            has the contract with Government to carry troops - but it seems that was an
            exaggeration. They go by rail to Nag Hamadi, and then are shipped. An officer told
            Theodore today, that the finishing of the railway between Nag Hamadi and Assouan, was to
            be pushed on to rapid finish. Nettie and I took a drive into Assiut this afternoon. A
            PAGE 144 very large and growing town - especially the European quarter - near the river,
            and American Mission College. We waited some time at the gate of a garden, where Abdul,
            and a kind of rais belonging to the carriage, a mere bundle of rags, with a smiling
            yellow face above, who seemed to be the elder brother of the two wretched little horses,
            went to get me some flowers. We thought we had never seen so many varieties of humanity
            as passed and repassed continually - with many it would have been hard from appearance
            to have drawn the line between the beast and the human. The Ramesis the Third came to
            the landing near us, and a small Gage steamer, with Prince Henri de Bourbon and party on
            board. We are having splendid nights - the moon just full. Made 10 miles today. Assiut.
            8 Jan. Saturday. Still here - having devoted the day to a general cleaning - to getting
            something done to our oven - to doing a big wash - Nettie and I took another drive this
            morning - into the town, and making the circuit of it. It is a holiday - being the 8th
            anniversary of the accession of the Khodive. The town was therefore crowded - and we
            drove through solid masses of turbaned humanity. We had no one with us but our driver -
            but we did not meet with the slightess rudeness - though it was as well perhaps that we
            did not understand all that was said to us. The moon makes such beauty, rising above the
            splendid palm and scent groves, that line the shore of the river opposite Assiut. PAGE
            145 First Sunday after the Epiphany. 9th Jan. We have had the warmest day of the year -
            and a very still one too - but have made Aboutig where we are not lying, 15 miles from
            Assiut - Theodore and Monty walked into the town, although it was almost dark when we
            tied up - and said it seemed very clean and charming. It always looks inviting, with its
            2 handsome twin minarets showing above the trees. Made 15 miles. 10 Jan. Monday. We had
            slipped along under light winds today, until we are within a short distance of Tahtah,
            and suppose we have made 25 miles. Warmer - and splendid moonlight nights. Tuesday, 11
            Jan. We are lying at Sohag - after a fine day of difficult sailing - beginning about 10
            o’clock. Very difficult bends of the river - we turn and turn upon our path - made 28
            miles. Sohag is on a hight bank with its handsome river front with its very good houses;
            looks quite unique for Egypt. We will wait here for the man who has been sent up from
            Cairo, with the new wash bowl for my room. Akmim. 12 Jan. We came the 5 miles from Sohag
            this afternoon, having waited all day for the plumber to finish his work in my room. We
            went for a PAGE 146 walk after breakfast, and seeing a little dahabeah flying the
            American flag, and hearing from one of our sailors that it was a “Hakim”, we thought it
            might be some of the people of the American Mission School, as we know they sometimes go
            out in this way - and wishing much to talk to them, we went down to call. But we found
            the “Hakim” was a dentist with a very Hebrew name, and his card bore the title of
            dentist to the Khodive. Theodore, asked him if he would like to see our boat, thereupon
            he came, bringing with him a most respectable citizen of Sohag, who he introduced as one
            of the “old Egyptian nobles” - whatever that might be. He then asked if he could bring
            the Mudir of the district in the afternoon - and about 3 o’clock they came, in some
            state. The Mudir was very well dressed in European fashion - and spoke admirable English
            - had a pleasant polished manner - and seemed much interested in the boat. Belliana, 13
            Jan. Had a good sailing day - the wind very strong at times. Struck a sand bank sharply
            - and had some difficulty in getting off. Passed Monshieh and Girgeh - the day very cold
            - with high wind. Nag Mamadi. 14 Jan. A fine warm day - wind light - reached this place
            at 4 o’clock - found the R.R. bridge closed - and after pulling up, heard that it would
            not open again today. Theodore and the rest went for a walk - and met and talked with
            the Engineer of the bridge - an Englishman - who PAGE 147 said it was entirely in the
            hands of the Government lately - as trains were running all the times, carrying troops
            to Assouan and the front. They saw a large barge with horses, and about 5 camels, and
            ammunition cars, waiting for the Lancashire regiment that comes up tomorrow. The bridge
            opens at 6 in the morning, and we hope to get through at once. Made 18 miles. Saturday,
            15 Jan. Got through the bridge this morning at 8 o’clock by towing - arrangements there
            very good. A strong north wind was too much for us, and we had to stop sailing long
            before noon, and tied up to the bank. About half past 5 we started and slowly moved
            along in a light wind for 2 miles, when we stopped - judging we had made ruing the day
            10 miles. 2d Sunday after Epiphany. 16 Jan. High wind in morning - laid up most of the
            day - sailed at 4 o’clock for an hour some 3 miles below Keneh - warm and pleasant. Made
            17 miles. Monday, 17 Jan. Started early - light wind and tracking made Denderah at noon.
            The day warm and delicious. Rode out to the Temple after lunch. My new saddle a great
            success. We had excellent donkeys and enjoyed the ride immensely. Flinders Petrie is
            excavating near Denderah. We could see PAGE 148 the dust of the excavations - and the
            comfortable looking house he has built there. As we reached the river again, we saw the
            Isis with an English flag passing - and a few moments after, the Alma appeared, and we
            are lying just behind her tonight 5 miles above Keneh. Tuesday, 18 Jan. Luxor. We
            reached Luxor at 6:30 this evening, having made a fine run of 44 miles. A rather
            exciting day too, as the Isis was just ahead, the Alma at our heels, and the Gazelle
            behind her. The wind was so light, it was hardly a zephyr and we stole along by the town
            like a ghost - and came into our old place just under the Castle. Wednesday, 19 Jan. We
            have a very good plan to lie - in a little cove just under the Castle - where no one can
            pull in ahead of us. The Alma lies, above, around the corner - and the Gazelle behind
            us. The Zenet-el Nil, with her owner M. Goliniescheff, the Hyksos, with the Shephards -
            and the Gamilla flying the German flag, are in port. Luxor looks cold, and quiet Achmed
            was waiting with his donkeys this morning, and we had just started, when we met Mr. and
            Mrs. Whitehead who are on the Ramesis, walking down to see us. Se we dismounted and
            walked back with them - as Mrs. W. had not seen the boat, and they were to leave for
            Cairo, at noon. Then we walked back to the Luxor Hotel with them - there mounted our
            donkeys, Theodore and I, as Nettie and Monty were visiting the Luxor PAGE 149 temple. We
            rode out towards Karnak, but it was too late to visit the temples, and stopping for a
            moment at the Hotel, we got home just in time for lunch. I stayed at home in the
            afternoon - enjoying our delightful deck, and the matchless and unique view across the
            stretch of the river, and the plain beyond, of the mountains. All day, the river has
            been so smooth, that the mountains with their soft, yellow pink have been reflected in
            it. Mr. James Stokes called late in the afternoon. He is one of the unfortunate
            passengers on the Rameses the Great who were unexpectedly disembarked here for several
            days, while the steamer was ordered forward to pull off some barges aground, full of
            stores and ammunition for the army, and to tow them to Assouan. Thursday, 20 Jan. This
            afternoon we all went to the Races - which were sufficiently amusing - saw the
            Vanderbilts who are here on their steamer the “Tewfik” and met unexpectedly Florence
            Taylor - who with her mother are up the river with the Thubrons in the Indiana, of the
            Anglo-American line. They ( the Taylors) came afterwards to the boat, with Sir John
            Scott, and we asked Mrs. T. and Florence to come back and dine with us - which they did,
            we sending the felucca for them. They were enchanted with our excellent dinner, poor
            starved things - a merry evening. They said for Nice, Feb. 12. Friday, 21 Jan. A
            delightful afternoon at Medinet Habu. The temple always so PAGE 150 interesting is now
            swept and almost garnished - and completely excavated. Saturday, 22 Jan. Theodore and
            Monty went to Karnac this morning - Nettie and I in the felucca to the German Cousuls,
            to see his antiquities. In the afternoon we stayed at home for a quiet reading on deck,
            and Theodore and Monty went to Der-el-Bahri - the air misty - and slight clouds
            everywhere. Late in the afternoon we went to return a visit to the Hyksos - and also to
            call on the ladies (4 of them) on the Alma. Miss Broderick, whom I was very anxious to
            meet is one of them - and we fell to talking at once on the Egypt Exploration Society’s
            affairs. 3d Sunday after Epiphany. 23 Jan. This afternoon Nettie, Monty and I went up to
            the Castle to call - and after we got home, Miss Broderick and Miss Morton came to tea -
            and young Cutting. 24 Jan. Monday. This morning Nettie and I rode to Carnac - but
            unfortunately forgot our tickets and came home - stopping at the American Mission book
            store, for the new Baedeker - Mr. and Mrs. Huhatt came to tea - and Miss Broderick and
            Miss Morton to dinner. A pleasant evening. Ramadan began today. PAGE 151 Jan. 25.
            Tuesday. M. and Mme. Insinger came this afternoon, and then sent down some beautiful
            flowers - Miss Dickson and Miss Kilburn from the Alma came to tea. The start for Assouan
            tomorrow morning. Jan. 26. Wednesday. A cold wind blowing all day - Mr. Huhatt came to
            play chess with Theodore, and to stay to luncheon - after luncheon, as we were having
            coffee, Mr. Somers-Clarke came in, having just arrived from El-Kab with Sir John Scott
            in his steamer. A pleasant visit - he telling about his new excavations at Kom el-Ahmar,
            opposite El-Kab, where they are finding tombs of great antiquity. He described a hawk’s
            head and body in bronze, of finest workmanship. He has come for 2 days at El-Bahari.
            This evening there is a real tempest going on - and additional ropes have been put out
            to the anchors - and it is cold. Thursday, Jan. 27. A great blow last night - I never
            knew a harder one here - and for a long time I could not sleep. Mr. Huhatt again came to
            play chess - Nettie and I never put our heads out of the boat. All the canvass and
            awnings had to come down last night - Miss Shephard and her friend came to tea. We shall
            be off tomorrow for Assouan. PAGE 152 Friday, Jan. 28. We got away about 9 this morning
            - but almost immediately the wind grew so strong that we soon took to the bank, and
            stayed until late in the afternoon - when we again started and made Erment about dark.
            Cold. Saturday, Jan. 29. Began tracking this morning at 8 - until we stopped at the Cook
            landing to get the men we had sent off for milk and fruit. Then went on tracking for
            about 2 miles, and at noon began sailing, and brought up tonight at 6:30 5 miles above
            Esneh - having made 30 miles. A beautiful sail all the afternoon - part of the time in a
            crowd of gyassas, laden rails for the railway in the south - some of them with cattle. I
            was on deck all day - most lovely sunset effects - warmer, though cold enough. 4th
            Sunday after Epiphany. Jan. 30. Silsileh. We have had a beautiful sailing day - and have
            made 52 miles. Yesterday we left the “Gamilla” lying at Esneh - soon after starting this
            morning we found her following us - and she is now lying ahead of us, having arrived
            soon after we did. Passed the “Gazelle” lying by. Passed El-Kab about 11 o’clock and
            Edfou at one o’clock - and pulled up beyond Silsileh at 6 o’clock. It has been warmer
            today, and is milder tonight. I have been on deck most of the day - such lovely
            colouring - and a sunset of of every colour of the rainbow - etherially delicate. Our
            moon is PAGE 153 now well on in her second quarter. The thermometer on my balcony this
            morning registered 36⁰. Monday. Jan. 31. Assouan. Started about 8 o’clock, and sailed
            splendidly all day - arriving at 4;30. The river was so full of gyssas, all laden with
            railway materials and army supplies, that the sailing was exciting. Found Assouan so
            crowded with the same, and all the quay near the R.R. station given up to unloading -
            even Cook’s landing stage has been moved down by the barracks to avoid the noise and
            bustle. We did not know at first where we could land - but at last feeling our way along
            Elephantine, we passed the Alma, and then the Pocahantus - and pulled in behind the
            Zenet-el-Nil, at the very beginning of the little sand gesireh - which is now indeed a
            very considerable island, so low is the river. However the bank is green with young
            wheat, and splendid palms above - and we congratulated ourselves, in spite of the fact
            that the Osiris lies beyond the Zenet - - then a great crowd of gyassas - then the Isis
            and Gazelle and then the Istar. Much warmer. Tuesday, Feb. 1st. Went over to the town
            this morning, and after sending a telegram, and getting our mail, we walked along the
            now really handsome quay, to the beginning of the barracks - where we found a new
            building - a Catholic Church and School - we walked into the Church, new and clean, and
            very good, with its marble floor, and arched roof - and sat down to PAGE 154 rest. Then
            to the Hotel to read the dispatches - I have never seen Assouan so busy - such crowds of
            boats, and business of unloading - such extraordinary crowds - much black, black faces.
            The long, well built quay now is really handsome - and many good new buildings. What a
            change from 10 years ago! To the Grenfell tombs - I waiting for the rest to clamber up
            and down, in the felucca with my book. Wednesday, Feb. 2d. This morning Miss Broderick
            and Miss Morton came for a visit, and invited Nettie and me to dine on Friday evening.
            Then we went across the river to the bazaar. All the things looked rather tame to me.
            Met a whole procession of military camels - this afternoon Mr. Sayce called - and as
            Theodore and Monty were going for a drive, he asked Nettie and me to come to tea. So
            when the felucca came back from the other side, we went to the Istar - and had a
            pleasant visit -tea on deck - then down stairs to see his room, old fashioned boat - 22
            ft. wide - while we are only 17-1/2. His saloon furnished in yellow brocatelle seemed
            enormous. We saw some good antiquities - and he showed us in the French Expedition book,
            the pictures of the temples on Elephantine, which were destroyed by Mohamet Ali to build
            a palace across the river, of which now no fragments remain. Invited Prof. Sayce to dine
            on Saturday. Thursday, Feb. 3d. To Philae this morning - Nettie and I, with Abdul in the
            train at 9 o’clock. Found all the Alma party at the station going too. The PAGE 155
            station is rather difficult to get to now, so encumbered is all the territory around
            with military stores - and with railway materials waiting shipment for the Soudan. A
            jolting, rattling three quarters of an hour brought us to Shellal - where there is a
            military encampment and more supplies - and steamers and barges for shipping them. I
            found Little Yemma waiting at the Philae landing - and he soon produced the delightful
            little Dendowi, not much changed or grown. Found Mr. and Mrs. Newman in the long
            colannade - he painting as usual, and looking very well, both very kind and hospitable,
            and asked us down to their boat for coffee, and to see his Japanese sketches. After
            luncheon Theodore and I went down - and spent a very pleasant hour. Home in a cataract
            boat, bring Miss Broderick and Miss Dickson with us. It was more exciting this descent
            than I have ever known it. I suppose because the water is lower than usual. Friday Feb.
            4. Very warm all day - and tired with my expedition of yesterday I stayed at home all
            day. The rest went off late in the afternoon for a row around the island, and came home
            complaining of the heat. Nettie and I went to dine with Miss Broderick on the Alma - and
            had a charming evening - with much music. Miss Kilburn playing the violin admirable. The
            row down to their boat, and back again to ours in the wonderful moon-light was
            delightful. PAGE 156 (not numbered) Saturday, Feb. 5. At home all day until the
            afternoon, when I went with the rest in the felucca in the mountain of the Coptic Dor. I
            sat in the boat with my book, while the rest climbed through the hot sand, and found the
            ruined convent very interesting. Mr. Sayce dined with us. He starts down tomorrow.
            Sunday. Septuagesima. Feb. 6. It was so warm this morning that we none of us felt
            energetic and Theodore proposed that we should sail up to the cataract, and get out on
            one of the islands. It was not much of a sail, as there was so little wind. But on
            coming to the first rapid water, we stopped at the nearest island of rock and sand, and
            walked about on the clean, hard sand, rifted over and over by the wind - and broken by
            huge masses of lovely rose granite. The Istar and the Zenet el-Nil started down that
            afternoon. Monday, Feb. 7. Warm and delightful all day. Did nothing. All the Alma people
            came to dine - and after dinner we went on deck to enjoy the wonderful moonlight.
            Theodore is growing anxious to get down the river, and talks of going on Thursday or
            Friday. Tuesday, Feb. 8. The first thing Theodore asked me as he came into breakfast
            this morning was “do you mind starting down today”. I said “no”, though I am always
            reluctant to leave Assouan. So after breakfast we crossed in the felucca to get our
            mail, pay a last visit to the bazaar, and send some telegrams, when we got back, we
            found the awnings being taken down and general preparations for the start. I wrote a
            hurried note to Miss Broderick, explaining our sudden change of plan - knowing that they
            had all gone to Philae for the day. At 12;30 we were off, and a light south wind
            springing up we came along right merrily - when the wind failed - the head has been
            intense - 95⁰ on my back balcony - but that has some reflection. Pulled up at 7 o’clock
            just as a sudden, howling wind came up and made our landing very difficult. Suppose we
            are about 5 miles from Kom Ombo. The air is so charged with sand that the moon can just
            be seen, wan and almost green - and she has lost a little slice off her. Very warm
            tonight. Wednesday evening. Feb. 9. We have only succeeded in making 2 miles today -
            when the N.W. wind increased so much we were forced to tie up, where we now lie. Since
            early this morning the same thick dust laden air of last evening - the sun showing dimly
            through it, like a pale full moon. Walking has been impossible - and we have stayed in
            doors. Thursday, Feb. 10. We came down the 3 miles to Kom Ombo where we now are. I
            wakened at 5 this morning, and found we were under way. After breakfast we went up to
            the temple, and spent two pleasant hours there - in PAGE 158 spite of high wind and the
            dust of the excavators outside the temple wall. While we were there the “Horus” came up
            with a tug, flying the English flag, and pulled up ahead of us. The views from the
            temple plateau are so splendid, I never want to come away. While we were sitting at
            lunch the “Cheops” appeared with tug, and English flag - but did not stop - and soon
            after the “Philetus” came sailing up, also with the English flag - and stopped, and next
            appeared the “Miriam” the Egyptian Museum boat, with a tug, and stopped behind us - so
            that the settlement is a large one tonight. We had had a pleasant scheme for taking tea
            in the temple this afternoon - but the high wind, and all the people from the boats made
            it impossible. Friday, Feb. 11. We are at a little mail station on the east bank called
            El-Eglit - about half way between Kom Kombo and Silsileh - and here we have stayed,
            prisoners of the North wind. The Osiris is in sight. Saturday, Feb. 12. All day at
            El-Eglit - a very stormy night - impossible to move - cold again. Sexigesina Sunday.
            Feb. 13. Started early this morning, and at 12 o’clock made Silsilis. Tremendous wind -
            with some difficulty made a landing on the West bank, and visited the different little
            shrines and Specs. Then got away, but PAGE 159 were nearly blown upon the rocks, which
            make this part of the river dangerous - and dropped our anchor just in time to save us.
            Finally succeeded in making about a mile where we now are, with the Osiris above us.
            Monday, Feb. 14. Early start - struggled along until after 9 o’clock, when we tied up -
            wind blowing hard - and still blows. Made 4 miles. Tuesday, Feb. 15. Started at 5:30 and
            stopped before 10 o’clock - wind so strong. Nettie and I walked along the railway
            embankment for some distance - but the flying sand and dust we found very disagreeable.
            Began rowing about 7 o’clock with the wind falling - and rowed until 8:30. We have seen
            the zodiacal light for a long time. Wednesday, Feb. 16. Began rowing at 6 o’clock - I
            looked out of my window, and saw a smooth water, a rosy, golden flush of dawn, and a
            waning moon high in the sky, reflected in the water. Brought up at Edfou at 8 o’clock -
            and found the Mena (Cook’s boat) with Col. John Hay, our Minister at London, and his
            party - and 2 other boats. Started soon after breakfast for the temple - where we stayed
            about 2 hours, and were back before lunch and off, and have been floating with a little
            rowing all day until 6:30 when we stopped. We are about 4 miles from El Kab. PAGE 160
            Thursday, Feb. 17. Reached El-Kab at 8 o’clock - found the Istar lying in front of the
            Antah - and while we were seated at breakfast, Mr. Somers-Clarke came in to see us, and
            to ask us to come to his boat to see the Sacred Hawk he had found at Kom el-Akmar. After
            breakfast I mounted a donkey, while the rest walked, into the old fortress and amongst
            its ruins, and then climbed the great wall 30 ft. or more thick, and I dismounted and
            walked on it - a rare view of desert, and river, and remains of former human habitation.
            Then we went to the Antar and saw the head and crown of the splendid hawk - as large as
            a big apple, of pure gold with a crown of gold 6 in. high, representing the Osiris
            feather crown - with eyes of obsidian - the workmanship fine and spirited. The body
            which we did not see, is of bronze, and much broken, but can be reconstructed. Then we
            were shown in the portico of the little house on shore, what is more interesting
            historically, a kneeling figure in stone, very crude and archaic, what Mr. S.-C. thinks
            belongs to the prehistoric time - also found at Kom El-Ahmar, where Mr. Quibell is
            excavating. In the afternoon we all rode out to the little temple of Amenophis III in
            the desert and had tea - we had never seen this pretty and interesting temple which Mr.
            S.-C. has illustrated and described. The ride through the desert valley - with the great
            arid mountains around us, and the evening colours, was something to remember. Evidences
            of the water courses, which are sometimes fed by the rains in the mountains were
            interesting. Mr. Sayce, and Mr. S.-C. came to dinner - a pleasant evening - talked over
            the Egypt Exploration Fund Society. PAGE 161 Friday. Feb. 18. Left El-Kab at 8 this
            morning - stopped in a high wind about 11. Made 10 miles - horrid. Saturday, Feb. 19.
            Reached Esneh at 9 - having rowed since very early in the morning - Theodore met the
            American dentist, who gave startling accounts of wind and cold below Luxor. Made about
            20 miles - and are now at Gebelein, 13 miles from Erment. Quinqungesima Sunday, Feb. 20.
            A day of hard work at rowing - until about 2 o’clock - this obstinate north wind stopped
            blowing - and in smooth water in a glory of beautiful colouring we came along, arriving
            at Luxor just after dark. We found the Osiris lying in our old place, and brilliantly
            illuminated, fizzing rockets and fireworks - so we hope she is going off tomorrow, and
            we have pulled in just behind her, and will take her place when she goes. Monday, Feb.
            21. Nettie and I walked into town - went to the German Consuls and looked at his
            curiosities. Sun warm, and much dirt. Mr. Huhatt came to play chess with Mr. Davis, and
            stayed to lunch. Mr. Insinger called. PAGE 162 Tuesday, Feb. 22. We have had up all our
            flag decorations in honor of the day. Mr. Varley called. The Hamilton Fisks just down
            from Assouan in the steamer came to dine. Wednesday, Feb. 23. The “Olga” with the Ayer
            family came down this morning and is near us. They came over at once to call. The “Alma”
            also arrived, and went across to the gezireh - and they all came over to see us. This
            afternoon we went over to the “Seura” Varley’s boat, to see his Nile sketches. Theodore
            bought the 2 best. Then we went to the “Hyksos”, to have tea with Miss Shepheard.
            Thursday, Feb. 24. Mr. Varley and Mr. Hooker came over and stayed a long time this
            morning - and a very pleasant morning it was. We were asked to the “Alma” for tea, but I
            did not feel well, and Nettie went alone. Mr. and Mrs. Huhatt dined with us. Friday, 25
            Feb. A quiet morning on deck with my books - it has been hot for days - and grateful the
            heat is. Miss Broderick and Miss Morton came to tea - and Mr. and Mrs. Ayer, and the
            daughter dined with us. PAGE 163 Saturday, Feb. 26. “Istar” came in early this morning -
            Nettie and I went to tea with Mr. Sayce - and the evening being so radiantly beautiful,
            we went out rowing all of us - and serenaded the “Alma” people. Sunday, Feb. 27. Nettie
            and I went to church this morning - over to the “Olga” for tea this afternoon with
            Theodore and Monty - met Mr. Fiske of Florence and Mr. Sayce - as the latter had been
            asked to dine with us this evening we also asked Mr. Fiske - and had a charming evening.
            Wednesday, March 2d. Have all been occupied with the Bend family, who arrived on the
            steamer on Monday - they dined with us that night and last night. yesterday we all went
            to Karnak in the morning - heat and dust indescribable, the rest went over to Medinet
            Habu in the afternoon - I wisely stayed at home. Mr. Fiske came to tea. Today all but
            Nettie, I and Mr. Bend, went to the Tombs of the Kings - we going over in the afternoon
            to meet them at Der el-Bahri - first visiting Der el-Medinet which I had never before
            seen - a charming little temple, in its desert gorge - coming home by moonlight -
            frightful wind and dust. Thursday, March 3d. Yesterday the north wind got up early and
            strong and has blown without cessation all day. I did not go out this morning - Mr. PAGE
            164 Bend and Beatrice to lunch - all went to the races in the afternoon - afterwards
            Nettie and I to tea with Mrs. Huhatt, and farewell visits to the Castle, and to Miss
            Shepheards. Then the Bends came to dine, and all went on donkeys to Karnak by moonlight,
            except Mr. Bend, Nettie and I, who had not the courage to face the wind and dust. I have
            settle many little matters - and we hope to get off tomorrow - the Bends going off in
            their steamer at 5 o’clock for Assouan. All the dahabeahs but ours have gone down.
            Friday March 4. We got off this morning at last - but the wind a little dead against us.
            For a time we thought we would have to tie up at Karnak, but we have come along in spite
            of it to within a mile of Nagada - and are lying in the splendid moonlight at a high
            bank crowned with the finest palm trees I have ever seen. The day fine - not too warm -
            on deck the whole day. Saturday, March 5. The men began rowing at 5 o’clock this morning
            - and the morning was quiet until about noon when the north wind got up, and still stays
            up. It is now 9 o’clock - and we are anchored in mid river. The night is as bright as
            day. We made Keneh at 5 o’clock - and are now only a mile below. The “Nephtys” passed us
            this morning with her tug - and soon after we descried the “Mimi” ahead of us - and
            found them both lying at Denderah. The “Tik” at the Keneh landing. The day a little PAGE
            165 cool. Three Dahabeahs have passed up today. Two of them flying the American flag.
            The “Manhattan”, and the “Queen of the Nile”, and this evening the “Stella” went up. It
            is a great year for dahabeahs. Made 25 miles. 2d. Sunday in Lent. March 6. We think we
            have made about 12 miles - since noon the wind has been strong and north - and the fact
            that the “Mimi” was so near us, induced our men to work hard in spite of the wind. The
            night is beautiful. Monday, March 7. A beautiful quiet day - and we have made 38 miles -
            no wind, except the lightest breath from the north now and then. Our men have rowed
            valiantly for 12 hours - and we are now lying about 6 miles from Ballianeh. The Mimi has
            been just behind us until 5 o’clock, when she stopped where the “Nephtys” and “Istar”
            were lying this side of Nagh Hamadi. We were just in time for the bridge at the latter
            place - which was just opening as we came up to it, and were the first to come through
            there being 3 steamers and the “Mimi” - and in spite of Theodore’s nervousness we got
            quickly and quietly through. Tuesday, March 8. Arrived at Balliana about 9:30 - found
            the Olga and the Alma lying near each other. All their people had gone out to Abydos,
            and except Miss Broderick - who came over at once to see us. We started ourselves in
            half an hour - the morning being cool and cloudy - and although the 2 hours ride out
            there even with the worst donkeys in the world, was delightful over that wide cultivated
            country - the wheat quite grown and bearded - oats well formed, and the air full of
            blossoming clover - yet the coming home was tiring in the extreme - bad donkey boys,
            unpleasant, natives, and intolerable donkeys, almost spoiled the lovely face of nature.
            We could not go to the tomb of Osiris as no one could tell us where it was. We have been
            baking bread today for the crew - and get off early tomorrow. Istar, Mimi, and Nephtys
            all here. Wednesday, March 9. Began rowing at 5:30 - at 9 o’clock the north wind was so
            strong we gave it up and went to shore. It blew a gale until 7 o’clock when we dropped
            down 3 miles to Girgeh - having made altogether the 8 miles between the two places.
            Passed 2 dahabeahs tonight - supposed to be the “Istar” and “Alma”. The air has been so
            charged with dust, and still is that the sun looked just as the full moon looks tonight.
            Thursday, March 10. High wind - made by rowing and drifting about 18 miles - and are
            very near Akmim. Friday, March 11. Reached Sohag this morning and stopped for the mail.
            The Alma PAGE 167 just starting out, as we pulled in. We have made about 5 miles below
            Sohag - altogether 12 miles. Saturday, March 12. A splendid day - began rowing in a calm
            at 4:30 A.M. when a gentle south wind came up, and carried us on to our victorious way
            until we reached Assiut at 7 o’clock P.M. - having made 63 miles. Olga, Alma and Istar
            here. The Ayers came over and spent the evening - but I did not see them being very
            miserable in my bed. 3d Sunday in Lent. March 13. Have made 6 miles this day. Left the
            Alma and Istar at Assiut looking after inscriptions in the Mountains I suppose. Overtook
            the Olga, but she has since floated out of sight. Monday, March 14. Another slow day,
            with north wind. We have passed Manfalout, making altogether we think about 22 miles.
            Tuesday, March 15. An exasperating day. We started early and rowed around the two great
            turns between Manfalout and half way past the Gebel Abou Feydah chain - and were
            congratulating ourselves that we were going to pass it, when the north wind became so
            strong, we had to stop before making the last turn - as these dangerous cliffs come down
            quite to the PAGE 168 water - and here we are still, with the lights of another dahabeah
            showing a little above us - we do not know what. Every night now we have 3 or 4 Gaffirs
            or guards watching us - as this part of the river always has a bad reputation - and
            there is much excitement now over the sad murder a short time since at Maghagah of Lord
            Cowper’s valet, who left the dahabeah for the Post Ofice, and missing his way back, was
            decoyed it is supposed into the sugar cane. His body was found the same evening robbed -
            and he had been strangled after a violent struggle. This has made a great stir -
            especially as two murders of natives in the same vicinity have since taken place. The
            “Mimi” passed us this afternoon in tow of a tug. Made about 8 miles. Wednesday, March
            16. In spite of the wind, we have come bravely along today - and are now just by
            Melawi-el-Arieh, having made 25 miles. This morning before 7 o’clock the Herodotus in
            tow passed down - and about 11 o’clock this morning we came upon her sticking tight in
            the sand. She must have been there a long time and we were just preparing to offer
            assistance, when she began to start. Too windy to be on deck today until about 4 o’clock
            when I went up - and we had tea there - and a beautiful sail, or row until dark -
            passing the end of the Abu Feydah chain - with a lovely bank of palm trees - villages -
            fields - cattle, sheep and the evening air of repose over all. There is a dahabeah just
            behind us, but too far for us to make her out. She is probably the Alma. PAGE 169
            Thursday, Mar. 17. Early this morning I was wakened by hearing Jones saying to Theodore
            in the hall that we were passing the Olga stuck in the sand, and raising my curtain I
            saw her plainly - her stern right in the bank and slightly tilted. None of the family
            visible - and she had the air of having adapted herself to the situation. Theodore sent
            word to ask if we could help her - but it seems she had been there for more than a day,
            and there was nothing but a tug - so after stopping a moment we came on. The Mimi passed
            us in tow later on - and we floated and rowed making Pinieh at 6:30, where we stopped
            for mail. Made 31-1/2 miles. Friday, Mar. 18. Started early, Mimi passed us as we pulled
            out and a good light wind has prevailed all day and we have come on splendidly. Passed
            Gelassaneh, abu Girgeh, Haghaha, and are now about 2 miles above Fasben having made 62
            miles. The river has been very difficult today in several places - we were on the sand
            for a few minutes - and I cannot imagine how the boats we left behind us can get through
            - as even we with our light draught find it so difficult. It rained gently for a little
            while today. Saturday, Mar. 19. Made about 8 miles this morning and got as far as Bibeh,
            when the north wind was so strong we had to drop our anchor to save ourselves PAGE 170
            from being sent on to the rocky cliffs - and we have not moved since, except as the wind
            has swayed us. The ominous sky brought the storm just as we had finished dinner. It blew
            tremendously, and the rain fell in torrents. The boat proved very tight, the only leaks
            being in my room, where the roof is higher - and at this offset there were several leaks
            - and towels, cups and bowls were put in requisition. I took a volume of McMasters
            History of the People of the United States from the bookcases this evening, and chanced
            upon the interesting and pathetic history of the settlement of Galliopolis in Ohio -
            which I had never read before. 4th Sunday in Lent. Mar. 20. I did not get to bed last
            night until nearly one o’clock. The storm which seemed to pass away in the evening,
            burst upon us again after eleven. All the family had gone to bed - so Theodore and I
            stayed up and again put in use the bowls, cups, and towels. For the first time, I really
            felt a little afraid as we were lying in the middle of the river - we had 3 anchors
            down, and the boat tugged at them most unpleasantly. Early this morning we pulled to the
            anchor to a safer place, and put out our 3 anchors on a little sand island, where we are
            still lying, the wind having blown great guns all day. The Ramses passed us early -
            feeling her way very cautiously indeed. I went on deck for a few moments after tea - but
            it was too windy to be pleasant - though the air was soft and deliciously full of the
            fragrance of clover blossoms. Wrote my Sunday letter to Mrs. Titus - and one to Jennie
            Buttles in Gambier. PAGE 171 Monday, March 21. We have had the most exciting day I ever
            passed o the Nile. We began the day early, with a light south wind - and found the river
            very difficult. About 10 o’clock we descried a Cook Steamer evidently stuck on the sand,
            ahead of us - and on coming up with her found her to be the Ammartis, which passed us
            yesterday. She was surrounded by gyasses, who were relieving her of some of her luggage.
            Not long after we passed the Steamer Shellal, a complete wreck, and partly submerged.
            She was deserted and in the hands of the wreckers - having stove a hole in her bottom on
            some unsuspected stones in the river. Half an hour after sitting at luncheon, our boat
            gave a sudden lurch, and there was a grinding of stones under her bow. We all rushed on
            forward deck, fearing some real calamity; but examination showed no leak, and we came on
            our way rejoicing; but it was rather nervous work for awhile. Next we saw one of the
            large Gage steamers, empty, and abandoned, and left tied to the bank, to wait for higher
            water, so that she could get down the river. Then we came up the Ammartis, who had got
            off the sand, and passed us a short time before, transferring her passengers to the
            Tewfik, who was sending her to the Ammartis - the latter drawing less water. So when we
            found ourselves tonight 6 miles below Wasta and having made 37 miles, and only touched
            sand once for a moment, we congratulated ourselves. A beautiful day and evening.
            Tuesday, Mar. 22. We were off this morning in a light south wind, at 6 o’clock. PAGE 172
            The wind shifted again and again, but at last came gently and steadily from the south,
            and we came rapidly along reaching Bedrasheen at 4 o’clock, and making the last 15 miles
            from there to Cairo or rather Ghizeh at 6:30. Here we found the landing place all along
            in front of the Museum, crowded with dahabeahs - and with some difficulty we found a
            place. I have never seen so beautiful an approach to Cairo - in the afternoon and
            evening light, the very picturesque scene of houses and trees at Old Cairo, and the
            island of Rhoda, dominated by the great Citadel with the dome and slender minarets of
            the mosque of Mohamet Ali were wonderful. Wednesday, Mar. 23. A warm, cloudless day -
            home all the morning, and driving with Nettie this afternoon. Thursday, Mar. 24. At home
            all day - very hot - high Kamseen wind. Istar came down tonight. Friday, Mar. 25. Drove
            into Cairo with Nettie in the morning. In the afternoon we had a delicious drive almost
            quite to the Mena House. The air so cool - the fields so green. Alas! they are building
            a trolley line to the Pyramids - and the avenue is very changed from what it was the
            first time I saw it. Now some disease seems to have attacked the lubbek trees PAGE 173
            and they are rapidly dying, with no apparent effort to replant. Young Courtlandt Bishop
            came to dine - and the two Ayers, father and son, came in to call - and told us about
            their troubles descending - having arrived yesterday morning. She was 2 days on the sand
            - and got off by employing a windlass and crew of a big gyassa passing. A new moon
            tonight. Saturday, Mar. 26. The wind blew great guns last night - and made such a noise
            - the water dashing and splashing under the stern, and my very head - and when I wakened
            this morning, the rain was dashing against my windows. Fortunately it did not rain hard,
            or last long - Theodore went in town to lunch with the Bends, and play chess. Nettie and
            I drove into Cairo on some necessary affairs, bringing Theodore home with us. Monty off
            riding - weather cool and delightful now. We are quite anxious over the dispatches of
            the day, from the United States. That Pres. McKinley’s message says that the Maine was
            destroyed from outside torpedo and that the U.S. had recognized the Cuban insurgents -
            very disquieting. 5 Sunday in Lent. Mar. 27. To the Museum this morning. Mr. Varley,
            Judge Royal, and Mr. Faviger came to tea and made a long pleasant visit. Amy Bend and
            Mr. Bishop also turned up - and Mr. Bend and the two girls came to dine. Mrs. Bend ill
            in her bed. Page 174 Monday, Mar. 28. Very hot all day - home in the morning - and at 5
            o’clock in the afternoon Nettie and I drove out to the Mena House and had tea, and home
            quite late. Tuesday, Mar 29. Theodore, Monty and I spent the morning at the Museum -
            principally in the rooms up stairs - and I came home well tired. Home all afternoon -
            very hot. Dr. James Ayer came to dine. Political news from home more reassuring.
            Wednesday, Mar. 30. The hottest day I ever spent on the Nile. My room, always the
            coolest on the heat, had a temperature of 80⁰ and the Cabana 90⁰. Theodore and I drove
            into town to see the Bends this morning. Home, and busy this afternoon with preparations
            for packing. Thursday, Mar. 31. An uncomfortable day - hot - strong wind - a busy day of
            packing and dismantling - the last night is always sade. Friday, April 1. Came to the
            Ghesireh Palace this afternoon - found the grand apartment formerly used by Ismail Pacha
            ready for us - the rooms enormous - richly furnished and decorated, the salon and my
            room looking on the river - and seeming very cool and comfortable this hot night.
            Saturday, April 2. Drove to the dahabeah this morning and then went to the Museum -
            where it was cool and delightful. Coming out the heat was so intense, that even in a
            covered carriage it seemed really terrifying. Late in the afternoon Nettie and I drove
            into town to shops and looked after many things. We keep the enormous windows of our
            rooms closed from early morning - until seven o’clock at night when they are opened for
            the cool air - and they admit also mosquitoes and bats. Sunday, April 3. Palm Sunday. I
            have not had the courage to move out of the house until at 6 o’clock, after having had a
            cup of tea, Theodore and I went over to Cairo to pay some farewell visits. In cross the
            bridge, the reflected heat from the iron at the sides, was like a blast from a furnace.
            We found Mrs. Sandwith in the garden with the children - she said the thermometer stood
            an hour before at 97⁰. Monday, April 4. A farewell visit to the boat this morning, and a
            visit to Phillips the antiquity dealer in Cairo afterwards. Very hot - with the same
            high, hot Khamseen wind we have had for 2 days. Mme. Sopher came over this afternoon to
            shampoo our heads. Our last preparations are all made - and we shall be off tomorrow -
            Rais Fuli and Abdul came PAGE 176 this evening to see the magnificence of the Palace. It
            was amusing to see their impressions. Hotel Bristol. Rome - Saturday, April 9th. Arrived
            last night - after a very good and comfortable voyage in the Rubitine Steamer Regina
            Margherita. Left Cairo the morning of Tuesday April 5, early - weather having so
            entirely changed, that we were cold in driving to the station. Rais Fuli, Abdul,
            Ebrahim, the Cook, and Mohamet Dervish, and our good Salah, were all waiting at the
            station for us. As Prince Mohamet Ali and the wife of the French Minister were all going
            by the same train, there was a very smart gathering of people - especially of red fezs -
            even Lord Cromer was there. The Ayers also crossed with us. The steamer was very clean
            and comfortable - I had a deck room, with a double bed, so delightful, with a good
            window by day, and an electric light by night, that I stopped in bed until 5 o’clock of
            the last day - with my books - and had a beautiful rest. Reached Naples and landed by 8
            o’clock - had breakfast at the Grand - and then a charming drive up the hill and over to
            Posillippo, and then back in time for early lunch, and off for Rome by one o’clock -
            which we reached for dinner in our pleasant sitting room at 7:30. Found piles of letter
            waiting. Very serious news as to probably war with Spain - and accounts of the brilliant
            and decisive battle fought by Kitchener, the Sirdar in the Soudan - great loss of
            dervishes. Mahomet the general captured. We have the corresponding rooms, only PAGE 177
            one storey higher, than those we had last year. Drove to St. Peters this morning and to
            Villa Borghese this afternoon. Hendrick Andersen dined with us - looking well and happy
            - last night and tonight. This morning to his pleasant studio - and were charmed and
            astonished at the vigor and originality of his work. Easter Sunday, April 10. Splendid
            weather, and services at St. John of Lateran this morning, and St. Peters in the
            afternoon - delightful music - and what effects in the St. Peters! Mrs. and Miss Bronson
            to dine with us. Monday, April 11. To the Museo delle Terme this morning with Anderson.
            To drive in the Borhese in the afternoon. Tuesday, April 12. Vatican with Anderson.
            Whiteheads turned up this evening. Wednesday, April 13. To the Vatican Pinacotheca -
            Mrs. House, Mr. and Mrs. Elliot to dinner. Dr. Richter called - interesting. Thursday,
            April 14. To various churches this morning - to a reception at Mrs. Elliotts in the
            afternoon. Dr. Bull to dine with us. Dr. Richter came DUPLICATE PAGE 177 PAGE 178
            Friday, April 15. To the Doria Pamfili this morning and then to the Lateren. In the
            afternoon drove in the beautiful Doria Pamfili gardens. Saturday, April 16. Rain all day
            and in the house. Mr. Ayer called. Sunday, April 17. Theodore and I drove out on the
            Appian way this morning - air deliciously warm and soft - but the wind so high and grew
            so violent we had to have the top of the carriage up - beautiful storm effects on that
            wide Campagna, with the tops of the Mts. white with snow. Mrs. Norman and Mabel came to
            dine. Monday, April 18. Theodore and I have been nosing about in the various shops of an
            old man who deals in frames in the Via Gergoriana. There were such beauties, it was hard
            to decide. Chose one of the best for a mirror to be placed in the hall over the hat
            table. Dr. Richter came to lunch - conversation about Leonardo, Boticelli, and other
            artists, and discussion of various pictures. Then we drove wwith them to visit by
            appointment the house of Donna Laura Minghetti, to see the famous leonardo da Vinci. A
            charming house, and an even more charming and hospitable hostess - and the beautiful
            picture was a sensation indeed. The Elliots called this evening. PAGE 179 Tuesday, April
            19. With the old frame man in Via Gregoriana this morning again and a charming drive,
            Theodore, Monty, Anderson and I had in the Doria Pamphili gardens this afternoon. They
            were not open to the public, but for some reason or other we were allowed to enter, and
            had all the drives and beautiful avenues to ourselves. Mrs. Ayer, the Normans to tea -
            and Dr. Richter to dinner - and we do not go to Florence tomorrow but the next day - for
            Theodore is trying to get a precious picture. Wednesday, April 20. Miserable weather.
            Poked into the old frame shop this morning with Theodore, and out in the rain for half
            an hour with Nettie though I did not leave the carriage. Dr. Richter to lunch - and then
            a very exciting afternoon - he and Theodore went off at 3 o’clock in a closed carriage
            to Donna Laura Minghetti’s to actually bring home in great secrecy, into our own
            possession, the incomparable Leonardo, to which we thought it such a privilege only a
            few days since, to be allowed to see. It is hard to realize that we have actually
            acquired it, it seems almost as if we have bought the Vatican or St. Peters! If we can
            only get it out of italy without arousing suspicion! Dr. R. to dinner. Hotel Cavour.
            Milan. April 29. We have made a great stride on our blessed way home to Toby PAGE 180
            and the Reef. Was having been declared, Theodore naturally began to feel uneasy, and to
            my great satisfaction decided to give up Venice, and go home on the Kaiser der Grosse
            the 25 May. Sent Monty over to Venice for 3 days there, and picked him up at Bologne
            yesterday as we came through. I lost all our short stay of a week at Florence - as I
            took to my bed at once with a sharp attack of influenza and did not leave it until the
            day we came away. Dr. Baldwin in attendance twice a day. The cold still hangs on - and I
            feel really shattered. Anderson came from Rome with the Normans on Monday - and it was
            delightful to have him again. Berenson and mrs. Castello to dine the night before we
            left and I got up for the dinner. I was furious that I could not go with Theodore to
            lunch with them, and see their pretty houses, which Theodore raved about. It rained all
            the time we were in Florence, and is still at it, The weather very heavy and
            discouraging. Lucerne - April 30. Hotel National. A perfect day for that incomparable
            journey over the Alps from Milan here. We seem to have left all the rain behind us.
            Arrived at 7 o’clock leaving Milan at 12:30 and found delightful rooms overlooking the
            lake. Sunday, May 1st. The brilliant sunshine looked into my room this morning and the
            views across the lake were glorious with the snow capped mountains, and the green hills
            enclosing the heavenly blue lake. Drove for 2 hours PAGE 181 ( no page number) this
            morning among the hills and around the lake. All the country is full of blossoming
            cherry trees - meadows gay with flowers - the hum of bees and the song of birds. I heard
            the nightingales at 4 o’clock this morning. Wrote letters this afternoon and we had tea
            out on our balcony. Magnificent sunset effects - rosy snow mts. and clouds - reflected
            in the blue lake! Monday, May 2. Another fine day - walking, driving and hunting over
            Bossards antiquity shop. Such a delight to think that next month at this time we ought
            to be at home - off tomorrow early for Paris. Hotel Westminster. Paris, Wednesday, May.
            4. We left Lucerne yesterday at 7:30 A.M. in clouds and rain, which continued all day -
            and arrived here at 6 o’clock. Came to our old quarters - most homelike - with the
            smiling familiar faces of the Concierge and his wife - Emil the waiter, and the kind,
            deprecating femme de chambre - news of the successful battle at Manilla, and the triumph
            of Commodore Dewey. Poor Spain - I am full of sympathy for the brave Queen Christina who
            has done all she could to rule and direct the troublesome country. Today it has been
            storming violently, with bursts of alternate sunshine. Mary and I were settling
            ourselves this morning - and began with gowns and shopping this afternoon. She has gone
            to the Circus with Theodore and Monty this evening - and I am keeping our cheerful salon
            company, with a bright wood fire. PAGE 182 Paris May 14. Since my last entry there has
            been nothing to write, except curses - deep and loud, against the weather. It has rained
            every day, persistently and continuously. I have not been out since the 4th, until
            yesterday, when I drove to Paquins a few doors off, and back. Theodore has had a great
            success with his Leonardo. She was invited to the Louvre, and compared with the Mona
            Lisa and the Madonna of the rocks. Braun has photographed her magnificently - and
            Theodore has given him the privilege of selling the photographs. Mary goes back home
            this morning. Jones and Amilie take her to the train, she has a compartment in the
            sleeping car which she does not leave until she reaches Pisa tomorrow night at 11
            o’clock - where Nettie meets her, and spends the night, and the have most of the day
            together there before going back to Florence. We go at 11 o’clock tomorrow via Calais to
            London. Hotel Bristol. London. May 17th. We came over very comfortably from Paris on
            Sunday - in spite of the rain. Fortunately it held up as we were getting on and off the
            boat, or it would have gone hard with me, as there is no protection whatever in the way
            of a roof. I had a nice little cabin, and laid down and slept most of the way - and the
            sea was smooth. Found our old quarters at this most comfortable of all hotels - and the
            weather has been good. Shopped a little and drove in the Park yesterday and today. PAGE
            183 This afternoon went with Theodore around to the Burlington Arts Club to see the
            collection of Milanese paintings - quite charming and interesting. Found the photograph
            of our Leonardo there opposite the Mona Lisa. We have had visits from the Farrars,
            Denbighs, Mr. Rathbone and Fielding - all the rest off to the theatre, as they were last
            night. I do not risk the exposure. Mr. Emmons here today - they sail tomorrow on the
            Teutonic. Sunday, May 22. The week has been rather quiet. I have had not dining out, no
            theatres or operas - as I do not go out in the evening. Theodore has been busy doing all
            of these things - and I scarcely see him, except at breakfast. The weather has been bad
            - today it is mending. I have had almost a daily drive in the Park - and yesterday I
            lunched with Lady Denbigh - and met some pleasant people. Tonight Theodore dines with
            Lord Denbigh - a man’s dinner for Lady D. has gone down to Nuneham to her family of 8
            children. Fielding came early yesterday, and he and Theodore knocked about to galleries
            and shops in the morning, and he came to lunch and went with us afterward to the
            Military Tournament; came back to tea - and went home and dressed, came back and ined,
            and he and Theodore had an old fashioned game of chess. I have just got home from a
            solitary drive in the Part - having first gone to tea with Miss Farrer. The Park lovely,
            backward as is the season, the trees are well out now, and the thorns beginning to show
            their flowers. Dr. Bridgman called after lunch and made me a visit - telling me all
            about PAGE 184 our war! how the Spaniards had a disciplined navy, and we had not - how
            much cleverer and quicker they were than we - what an unrighteous war it was - but that
            in the end we must win, for they (England) intended standing by us! Tuesday, May 24. Our
            last evening in London - and these two last days have been very busy - between friends
            and affairs. The weather still uncertain - we made the acquaintance of Mr. Sydney Colvin
            this afternoon. He came to see the Leonardo - and I talked a little with him about
            Stevenson. He looks rather a hard, dry fellow. Mr. Rathbone and Farrar here too. Last
            agonies of packing going on in all our rooms. Tuesday, June 1st. Holland House. Just one
            week ago tonight I made the last entry - and it is hard to realize - and now we are here
            again, after a very comfortable and monotonous voyage. The Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse is
            the finest ship I have ever sailed on. Such comfort, luxury, cleanliness - good service,
            and the best and most profuse table I ever saw. Mr. Rathbone and Fielding were at the
            station to say goodbye, the morning we left London. A quick and pleasant ride to
            Southhampton, and as we ran along the big dock, with the Kaiser lying close to it, she
            looked enormous from the train. On three consecutive days we made 560 miles - and the
            voyage would have made a record, had we not 2 days before reaching PAGE 185 New York,
            broke one or the blades of one of the screws. However, we were in our slip by 10:30 this
            morning. END vol 5 11 </body>
